# Command Line Tracker in C

This project is made in C. I am currently working on creating a hashmap struct with functions in order for better lookup time.
This map will be intergrated into another .c file called tracker, which will keep track of different movies/TV shows and their progression.

## To Do
- finish map.c
- start tracker.c
- test map.c
